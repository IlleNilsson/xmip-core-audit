//! The Windows Event Log: an entry in the Application log, event 1000, under
//! the event source `XMIP_EVENT_SOURCE` (`xmip_operate.h` section 9,
//! ADR-0062 clause 3), written through the Event Log's own C interface.
//!
//! Registering the source needs elevation once; the prerequisite installer
//! does it. Until it has, an entry is written under the Application log's
//! existing `.NET Runtime` source, whose event 1000 shows the text as given,
//! and its first sentence says why. The `windows-event-log` technology under
//! this capability in `architecture.xmip`.
//!
//! The one file in this crate that may hold unsafe code (ADR-0050, amendment
//! 2026-09-25): the Event Log and the registry are C interfaces and are
//! reached no other way. Every block says where its pointers come from, how
//! long they live and who frees what they hand back.
