//! The operating system's log: where a record goes when audit cannot
//! persist it (ADR-0062 clause 3) — the Windows Event Log, the systemd
//! journal or syslog on Linux, the unified log on macOS.
//!
//! It is the fallback, not a second sink: [`crate::emit::Audit`] is the
//! only caller, and only after the configured sink refused a record or
//! there was none. Each platform's writer is a technology under this
//! capability in `architecture.xmip`; they live here because the fallback
//! is the capability's own rule and a capability does not depend on its
//! technologies (ADR-0044).
//!
//! On Unix the record is one datagram to the local syslog socket, which the
//! journal reads on a systemd machine and the unified log on macOS; no unsafe
//! reaches it. On Windows the Event Log has no interface but a C one, called
//! from `windows_event_log.rs`, the one file in this crate that may hold
//! unsafe code (ADR-0050, amendment 2026-09-25).
