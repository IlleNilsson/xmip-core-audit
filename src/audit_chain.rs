//! The audit log is a chain, one per writer (ADR-0070 clause 5, amended
//! 2026-10-10: *one chain per writer* — the node's, or the program's where
//! no node writes it): every record carries its number in its writer's
//! chain, the SHA-256 digest of the record before it there and its own,
//! taken over its canonical form, which holds the number and the digest
//! before it. A deleted, changed or reordered record breaks the chain where
//! it was, and [`walk`] says where, in words.
//!
//! The rule is here once. The file sink forms the chain as it appends
//! (`crate::file_sink`), Xmip Storage as it writes a node's records
//! (`xmip-core-persist`, its one writer to the runtime database); each
//! computes its records' digests over its own canonical form with
//! [`digest`] and hands the records of one writer, in the order the log
//! holds them, to [`walk`], which is what every verification calls.
