//! The audit record: the persistent accountability record of what Xmip did,
//! where, by whom, why, when and with what outcome — for every action a node
//! takes and for every Xmip program (ADR-0062).
//!
//! An [`audit_record::AuditRecord`] carries its origin, its scope when it
//! has one, its action, phase and severity; an [`AuditPolicy`] decides
//! record or suppress; an [`AuditSink`] persists; [`emit::Audit`] is the
//! one place that puts the three together, and the one place that sends a
//! record the sink could not keep to the operating system's log
//! ([`operating_system_log::OperatingSystemLog`]). Failures are always
//! audited and failure records are always persisted; that is not policy.
//!
//! A program audits through [`program_audit::ProgramAudit`], whose default
//! sink is [`file_sink::FileSink`]: the directory it is told, else
//! `XMIP_AUDIT_DIRECTORY`, else none and the operating system's log. A
//! record made where the caller must not wait for a disk is handed to the
//! [`keeper`], one thread that keeps records in order.
//!
//! A reader reads the same file back: [`audit_store::read`] keeps what it
//! read and reads only what was appended since, [`audit_entry::AuditEntry`]
//! is a record read back, and [`audit_query::AuditQuery`] is what every
//! surface asks of it — who, the scope pattern, severity, action and time,
//! sorted by any column and paged (ADR-0062, amendment 2026-09-29). Who a
//! record is, is the location its process declared, which
//! [`program_audit::ProgramAudit::locate`] puts on every record.
//!
//! The audit log is a chain, one per writer ([`audit_chain`]; ADR-0070
//! clause 5): the file sink chains each record it appends, and one walk says
//! where a chain breaks, for the file and for what Xmip Storage keeps. A
//! write left unfinished is sealed apart by the next append and said by a
//! verification apart from the chains ([`audit_fragment`]).
